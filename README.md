  + Comment: Momentum strategy is one of the most wide-known market anomaly in finance. While traditional momentum strategy is based on a few pre-specified past returns, their strategy is based on the features extracted from multiple past returns by a stacked autoencoder, which mitigates the bias in specifying the prior period over which to measure stock returns.

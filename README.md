# Quantitative-finance-papers-using-deep-learning

## Background
Deep learning have become increasingly used in the field of finance. One of the difficulties in developing financial models arises from the fact that there is not a standard data like MINST or CIFAR. Experiments have been usually carried out under different conditions such as periods, country, and private data, and consequently, the models are exposed to experimental bias. Due to the difficulty of directly comparing the performance of the developed models, we cannot simply adopt the model with higher performance. I would like to introduce some papers on financial time series prediction and its applications, hoping that they will provide information that will help in the development of new and improved perdictors for use in investment and risk management.

  + Comment: Momentum strategy is one of the most wide-known market anomaly in finance. While traditional momentum strategy is based on a few pre-specified past returns, their strategy is based on the features extracted from multiple past returns by a stacked autoencoder, which mitigates the bias in specifying the prior period over which to measure stock returns.

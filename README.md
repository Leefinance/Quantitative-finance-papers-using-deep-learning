# Quantitative-finance-papers-using-deep-learning

## Background
<!Deep learning have become increasingly used in the field of finance.> 
I would like to introduce some papers on deep learning model-based forecasting and its applications, hoping that the tecniques employed in them will be used as components in developing new systems for investment and risk management.

measurement through machine learning simplifies the investigation into economic mechanisms of
asset pricing and highlights the value of machine learning in financial innovation.
